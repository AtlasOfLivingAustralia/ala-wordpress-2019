## Local development

### Installation

Working in the [Pivotal Docker Dev environment](https://github.com/pvtl/docker-dev), you'll need to do the following:

- You'll need `DB_HOST=mysql` in your `.env`
- You'll need to create a symlink of `/public` to `/web` (`ln -s web public`)
- Your Hostname will need to be {website}__.pub.localhost__ (note the `.pub`)


## Developing With NPM, Gulp, SASS and Browser Sync

### Running

From the `understrap-child` theme directory: to work and compile your Sass files on the fly start:

- `$ gulp watch`

Or, to run with Browser-Sync:

- First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in the file `/gulpconfig.json` in the beginning of the file:
```javascript
  "browserSyncOptions" : {
    "proxy": "localhost/wordpress/",
    "notify": false
  }
};
```
- then run: `$ gulp watch-bs`
